## Use JavaFX with Gradle

Using a build tool like Gradle in combination with Git it is very easy to for other developers to start immediately with the project. They don't have to install or set up JavaFX or other dependencies. It it much more convenient and safer and faster to use a Gradle as a build tool. Also Gradle is quicker and easier to set up when starting a new project like Maven.

If you want to set up a new project with JavaFX it is more easier to use IntelliJ and Gradle to build the project than with Eclipse. [Here](/javafx-gradle-template-info) is an already set up example template.
